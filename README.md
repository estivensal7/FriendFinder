## How does it work?

Friend Finder is a node application deployed on Heroku. Data is saved in a file not in a Database. We utilize Express to configure, and operate the server, Body-Parser to pass information from the server to the client, and back. Various routes are set up to complete the survery, and retrieve all values from the client to View the JSON API, and post data into the application.

##Deployment

Deployment on a node server is required. Since no database is required, setup should be a simple matter of simply uploading the files and having the server listen for a request.
